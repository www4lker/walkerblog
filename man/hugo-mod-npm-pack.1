.SH NAME
.PP
hugo-mod-npm-pack - Experimental: Prepares and writes a composite package.json file for your project.


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBhugo mod npm pack [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Prepares and writes a composite package.json file for your project.

.PP
On first run it creates a "package.hugo.json" in the project root if not already there. This file will be used as a template file
with the base dependency set.

.PP
This set will be merged with all "package.hugo.json" files found in the dependency tree, picking the version closest to the project.

.PP
This command is marked as 'Experimental'. We think it's a great idea, so it's not likely to be
removed from Hugo, but we need to test this out in "real life" to get a feel of it,
so this may/will change in future versions of Hugo.
